## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Project Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is built using PHP for server-side functionality and follows a provided style guide for the game’s user interface. The project allows two players (X and O) to take turns selecting cells in a 3x3 grid. The game ends when either player achieves three matching marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), or when all cells are filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).

### Features

	•	Two-player game: Players alternate between X and O.
	•	Game ends when one player wins (3 in a row) or when there is a draw.
	•	Simple, user-friendly interface built to conform to the provided style guide.
	•	Game logic written in PHP, using functions provided in the project specifications.
	•	Dynamic updates: Once a cell is selected, it is replaced with the player’s mark (X or O) and cannot be clicked again.

### Technologies Used

	•	HTML/CSS: For the structure and styling of the web page, based on the provided style guide.
	•	PHP: Server-side scripting for game logic, turn management, and win/draw detection.
	•	Git: Version control system for managing project updates and branching.
